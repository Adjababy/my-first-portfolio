                    Starting in 2020, fifth-generation (5G) communications networks were scheduled for deployment worldwide. However, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the deployment of these networks has been partially restricted to sixth-generation (6G) networks. <br>
                     The motivation behind this initiative is to apply high-frequency carriers to millimeter waves (mm waves), which will significantly boost the capacity of wireless networks.<br>
                      In the present work, we propose a communication system based on hybrid millimeter-wave transmission technologies using a fiber-optic backhaul/optical wireless link. The performances of transmission quality measurement are judged by, BER, Q-factor, received optical signal power and with the representation of an eye diagram. Finally, the link is simulated using OptiSystem software.
